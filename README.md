# R code for RNA-seq analysis of G-CSF in lung cancer

## Study

Tumor-derived G-CSF promotes immune evasion and lung metastasis via PD-L1 
upregulation and immunosuppressive microenvironment remodeling.

## Data

RNA-seq data: GEO accession [GSE343634](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE343634)

- Differential expression analysis was performed by BGI Genomics using DESeq2.
- Downstream analyses (volcano plot, GSEA, transcription factor activity, 
  heatmap, and regulatory network) were performed in R on the BGI-provided 
  differential expression table and expression matrix.
- Reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome **GRCm39** 
  (NCBI GCF_000001635.27) using HISAT2, and gene expression was quantified 
  as FPKM using Bowtie2.
- In the differential expression table, "N" and "S" denote the sh-NC and 
  sh-Csf3 groups, respectively. log2FC values are oriented so that positive 
  values indicate up-regulation in sh-Csf3 relative to sh-NC.

## Note

Statistical analyses and graphs for the experimental data (Figs. 1C–O, 2,
